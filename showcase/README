The examples are not independents, they strongly rely on the ../framework 
directory and the structure if this directory. To show the component 
capabilities I tried to make a clear structure for this sub-project.

================================================================================
The directory structure you see:

examples
    contains a reference implementation of the auth box It uses $_SESSION 
    environment variable to start the login information without design, but a 
    later easily designed interface.

lib
	This directory stores Some own developed modules dor the showcase, and other
	projects to make it help to be more impressive.
