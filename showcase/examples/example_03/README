This Example is a start point to the UACP framework. Tihis example is made for
to the a look to the templating capabilityes of the framework. Just simply
craete a directory where you would authenticate, put the template files there,
give the directoy name you created previously as a second pararmeter to the
constructor of the AuthBoxFromDirectory. And you can use your templates for
your authentication.

This example shows an example for autoredirection to a different layout if the
user is logged in.
	
If you reload or fail the login three times the captcha authentication is 
required to pass the authentication process.
