This is the root directory of the UACP that stands for 
Universal Authentication For PHP.

The directory structure you see:

./framework ; 
	Here is the little framework that helps for you to make your 
	authentication flexible and easy.
	
./lib ; 
	The libraries needed to run the framework, and the showcase.
	(currently there is no dependencies,
	)
./showcase; 
	Here are (will be) the examples to make it look delicious:)
