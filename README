This is the root directory of the UACP that stands for 
Universal Authentication For PHP.

Welcome to the UACP!

Uacp stands for Universal Authentication component For PHP(5)

The aim of this project is to create an easy to (re)use authentication 
component for PHP applications.

You can see how it works at:
http://uacp.x10hosting.com/showcase/lib/tools/gwt/uacp_showcase/war/Uacp_showcase.html

The guiding principles of the project are:
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|-Well documented, and self documentative.
|-Easy to reuse.
|-Database independent.
|-By its own really easy to learn templating system you can create fully 
| customized designs for your authentication tasks.
|-No external dependencies.
|-Uses only the OOP paradigm, and PHP5.
|-Fully unittested.
|-Functionally tested.
|-Easy to learn by examples.
|-This framework supports iterative development and agile development 
| friendly. You can easily create authentication related prototypes.
|-Fits into the MVC Designpattern.
|-Apache 2 license

INSTALLATION:
Just copy the framework library anywhere where it is reachable from your 
project and include the autoload.php file from it, modify one line if you would
like to use the Captcha support in this case your environment sould have session
support.

You can use the examples to start your authentication module.

================================================================================
The directory structure you see:

./framework ; 
	Here is the little framework that helps you to make your authentication
	flexible and easy. In the case you yust would to use the framework and
	don't want to develop it you only need this folder.
	
./showcase; 
	Here are (recently only one) the examples to make it look delicious:)
	Just copy the framework to your webserver that uses php5, browse the 
	showcase examples, they automatically start, you can see how they
	are working in practice. I use Ubuntu 9.10 with apache and php, so 
	the application should run on any compatible configuration, but of 
	course. I will test the component on other configurations as well 
	in the near future.
