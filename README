This is the root directory of the UACP that stands for 
Universal Authentication For PHP.

Welcome to the UACP!

Uacp stands for Universal Auhthetication component For PHP(5)

The aim of this project is to create an easy to (re)use authentication 
component for PHP applications.

The guiding principles of the project are:

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|-Well documented, and self documentative.
|-Easy to reuse.
|-Database independent.
|-By its own really easy to learn templating system you can create fully 
| customized designs for your authentication tasks.
|-No external dependencies.
|-Uses only the OOP paradigm, and PHP5.
|-Fully unittested.
|-Functionally tested.
|-Easy to learn by examples.
|-This framework supports iterative development it is agile developement 
| friendly. You can easily create authentication related prototypes.
|-Fits into the MVC Designpattern.
|-Apache 2 license

INSTALLATION:
Just copy the framework library anywhere where it is reachable from your 
project and include the autoload.php file from it. You can use the examples to
start your authentication module.

================================================================================

The directory structure you see:

./framework ; 
	Here is the little framework that helps for you to make your 
	authentication flexible and easy.
	
./showcase; 
	Here are (recenty only one) the examples to make it look delicious:)
	Just copy the framework to your webserver that uses php5, browse the 
	showcase examples, they automatically starts, you can see how they
	are working in practice. I use Ubuntu 9.10 with apache and php, so 
	the application should roun on any compatible configurations, but of 
	course I will improove the compatibility list more specific in the near
	future.
