This is the root directory of the UACP that stands for 
Universal Authentication For PHP.



Welcome to the UACP!

Uacp stands for Universal Auhthetication component For PHP(5)

The aim of this project is to create an easy to (re)use authentication 
component for PHP applications.

The guiding principles of the project are:

|-Uses only the OOP paradigm, and PHP5.
|-Well documented, and self documentative.
|-Easy to reuse.
|-Database independent.
|-No external dependencies.
|-Fully unittested.
|-This framework supports iterative development, and because of this it is 
| agile-friendly, So you can easily createh authenticatin related prototypes 
| with the help of this framework.

The directory structure you see:

./framework ; 
	Here is the little framework that helps for you to make your 
	authentication flexible and easy.
	
./lib ; 
	The libraries needed to run the framework, and the showcase.
	(currently there is no dependencies.)
./showcase; 
	Here are (recenty only one) the examples to make it look delicious:)
	Just copy the framework to your webserver that uses php5, browse the 
	showcase examples, they automatically starts, you can see how they
	are working in practice. I use Ubuntu 9.10 with apache and php, so 
	the application should roun on any compatible configurations, but of 
	course I will improove the compatibility list more specific in the near
	future.
