This is the root directory of the UACP that stands for 
Universal Authentication For PHP.

The directory structure you see:

./framework ; 
	Here is the little framework that helps for you to make your 
	authentication flexible and easy.
	
./lib ; 
	The libraries needed to run the framework, and the showcase.
	(currently there is no dependencies.)
./showcase; 
	Here are (recenty only one) the examples to make it look delicious:)
	Just copy the framework to your webserver that uses php5, browse the 
	showcase examples, they automatically starts, you can see how they
	are working in practice. I use Ubuntu 9.10 with apache and php, so 
	the application should roun on any compatible configurations, but of 
	course I will improove the compatibility list more specific in the near
	future.
