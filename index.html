        <h1>UACP</h1>

<p>This is the root directory of the 
UACP that stands for Universal Authentication For PHP.</p>

<p>Welcome to the UACP!</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Uacp stands for Universal Authentication component For PHP(5)</p>

<p>The aim of this project is to create an easy to (re)use authentication component for PHP applications.</p>

<p>You can see how it works at:
<a href="http://showcase.uacp.info/showcase/lib/tools/gwt/uacp_showcase/war/Uacp_showcase.html">UACP show case</a></p>

<h2>The guiding principles of the project</h2>

<ul>
<li>Provide a solid starting point for the authentication of starup projects.</li>
<li>Well documented, and self documentative.</li>
<li>Easy to reuse.</li>
<li>Database independent.</li>
<li>By its own really easy to learn templating system you can create fully customized designs for your authentication tasks.</li>
<li>No external dependencies.</li>
<li>Uses only the OOP paradigm, and PHP5.</li>
<li>Fully unittested.</li>
<li>Functionally tested.</li>
<li>Easy to learn by examples.</li>
<li>This framework supports iterative development and agile development friendly. You can easily create authentication related prototypes.</li>
<li>Fits into the MVC Designpattern.</li>
<li>Apache 2 license</li>
</ul><h2>INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>Just copy the framework library anywhere where it is reachable from your project and include the autoload.php file from it, modify one line if you would like to use the Captcha support in this case your environment sould have session support.</p>

<h2>The directory structure you see:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>./framework ; 
Here is the little framework that helps you to make your authentication flexible and easy. In the case you yust would to use the framework and don't want to develop it you only need this folder.</p></li>
<li><p>./showcase; 
Here are (recently only one) the examples to make it look delicious:) Just copy the framework to your webserver that uses php5, browse the  showcase examples, they automatically start, you can see how they are working in practice. I use Ubuntu 9.10 with apache and php, so  the application should run on any compatible configuration, but of  course. I will test the component on other configurations as well in the near future.</p></li>
